# Procedural Content Generation

A long and difficult assignment with the goal of developing a diorama
where most if not all assets are procedurally generated. Though my diorama
has some assets that are static and do not change. It was still viable and
was accepted. 

Most of the models were developed in Blender, with influence from real world
objects and games. The theme for my world was for a futuristic city inside
of the moon, though there is a lake this was a part of the theme and 
"Story". The roof was meant to be similar to the floor where it changes
each time the world is loaded; however this did not go as planned and 
ultimately was left flat. 

The project should run straight from download without any need for changing
anything. 

Thank you for looking at my work.
