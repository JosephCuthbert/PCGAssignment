<p>This logger only requires you to start and end the logger, the rest is handled for you.
Once activated, the logger will record the frametime for every frame; on dump, a summary will be generated, a long with pulled system specs, and the full log.</p>
<p>Include the namespace QFSW.PL to gain access to the performance logger</p>
<p>To begin, call <code>PerformanceLogger.StartLogger();</code></p>
<p>To end and dump the logger, call <code>EndLogger(string Path, string ExtraInfo = "", bool Async = true, Action CompletionCallback = null)</code></p>
<p><code>Path</code> is the full file path (name included) of the dumped log file</p>
<p><code>ExtraInfo</code> is a string that will be prepended to the log file, this could be useful to use as a version number</p>
<p><code>Async</code> will cause the dump to run in async mode, which is highly recommended for large dumps. If this is used, you should use the <code>CompletionCallback</code>, which will execute (on the main thread) as soon as the dump process is done. This is useful for disabling a message.</p>
<p>If you want to log a custom event, such as spawning a boss, use <code>PerformanceLogger.LogCustomEvent(string EventData)</code>, and the event will be added to the log file.</p>
<p>An example of the log file can be seen here:
